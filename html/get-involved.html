<h1>Joining FAMAT</h1>
  While this covers the introductory steps, sponsors should
    <a href="downloads.html">download the Sponsor's Guide</a> and read it for more information.
  <h2 class="mt-5">Register your school</h2>
<p>All high schools must <a href="how-to-join.html"> register a Mu Alpha Theta chapter</a> to
    compete in FAMAT. National registration fees are one-time-only. Middle schools are exempt.</p>
<p>To register with FAMAT, email <a href="email-protection#8be1e4e2e5cbedeae6eaffa5e4f9ec.html"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="13797c7a7d5375727e72673d7c6174">[email protected]</span></a> with your name and your school's
    name and address. You'll be assigned a school code.</p>
<p>Florida is divided into 5 regions to minimize driving time/distance for Regional Competitions. The first digit of
    your school code is your region number.</p>
<h2 class="mt-5">Set up your portal</h2>
<p>Once you receive your login information, you should <a href="login.html">sign in</a> to add
      links to the next steps below.</p>
<p>The first step is to set up your contact information. This will be used for FAMAT communications.
  </p>
<p>Next, set your 
    school information. Any information you put here is visible to other sponsors.</p>
<h2 class="mt-5">Enrollment and finances</h2>
<p>In the other tabs on your school
    page, you'll find your student list and balance.</p>
<p>You can add and remove students from your school at any time. If you remove a student before the deadline for
    yearly dues, you won't be charged, but if you remove a student after the deadline, the charge will remain on your
    account.</p>
<p>Current high school dues are
    $15.00 per student with a
    minimum of $150.00 per school.
    Middle school dues are a flat fee of
    $150.00.</p>
<p>If your school requires invoices, you can make an invoice for your student dues in the balance tab of your school
    page. Also in that tab are your previous invoices and the payments received.</p>
<p>General competition fees will <em>not</em> appear in your school portal, as they are collected by the schools
    running each competition.</p>
<h2 class="mt-5">Get students involved</h2>
<p>FAMAT is a state affiliate of the <a href="index.html">Mu Alpha Theta National Honor Society</a>, and
    being a part of their group is a great way to get students involved in service.</p>
<p>FAMAT, and Florida as a whole, has significant student communities and leadership. The <a href="index.html">Student Delegates</a> run a Facebook group, Discord server, and mailing list for
    students. They run an online competition in the fall, host meetings and lunch groups during the regular season, and
    coordinate student awards and events at the State Convention.</p>
<p>A number of large and small schools run math team-specific classes for students that are highly interested in math.
    This is a great way to challenge students with exceptional interest and grow their love of math, and be more
    competitive in FAMAT.</p>
<h2 class="mt-5">First events</h2>
<p>The first competition of the year is the Fall Interschool in November, which will be available on the website
    during the competition.</p>
<p>The first individual competition, in December, is the Hiller/Nunn/Dostal tests. It is mail-in. More information can
    be found on its competition page.</p>
<p>During the January-to-March regular season, there are two main types of competition. Invitational Competitions are
    open to the entire state, and hosted at one school. Regional Competitions are hosted at multiple schools at the same
    time.</p>
<h2 class="mt-5">Register for competitions</h2>
<p>You can <a href="competitions.html">find upcoming competitions</a> and register online.
    Once you've registered, the competition host will manage further communication.</p>
<p>For regional competitions, your school can request to compete outside its region if the travel is shorter or there
    is no competition in your region by filling out the form in the Sponsor Packet.</p>
<h2 class="mt-5">Go to Competitions</h2>
<p>Between tests, disputing problems, and lunch activities, students are generally busy throughout competitions.
    Students are encouraged to attend Student Delegates meetings at lunch to meet others like them, get involved in
    leadership, and participate in mini-events such as Countdown.</p>
<p>Lunch is provided for sponsors. Sponsors are expected to "work" for a round of competitions they attend, such as by
    proctoring tests or monitoring team round.</p>
<h2 class="mt-5">State Convention</h2>
<p>The State Convention is the height of the FAMAT season. Held at the Rosen Plaza Hotel in Orlando, schools across
    Florida travel to compete in a diverse array of events and meet other students. In addition to topic events such as
    Logs and Exponents or Probability, there are a Scrapbook competition, Poster, and the Brian Holt Computer
    Competition.</p>
<p>The Student Delegates hand out Squirty Chicken awards for season-wide high performers, run an Integration Bee, and
    elect the new Delegate leadership.</p>
